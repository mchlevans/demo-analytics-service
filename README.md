# Python Analytics Service
This is the python analytics used in the [demo analytics dashboard](http://analyticsloadbalancer-1260159310.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)!

Depending on when you're reading this, the contents of this repo could include some amount of code not used in the dashboard, as I anticipate continuing to iterate on the code here, which may or may not be used in the latest deployed version of the dashboard.

This service can be built and run locally with Docker and Docker Compose, or for live reloading, can be run with the development server (```scripts/localRun.sh```) which is useful when working on the Matplotlib visualizations.
